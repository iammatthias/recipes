I believe that cooking is a communal act. Food and drinks bring people together, and elicit joy when shared and celebrated. 

By making this collection of found and adapted recipes "open source" I hope to encourage others to explore and improve on what I have. Comments, feedback, and pull requests are welcome. My one request is that you adhere to the existing markdown template. 

Feel free to fork this repository, adapt these recipes to your taste, or add your own creations. If you make something delicious, consider sharing it back.
