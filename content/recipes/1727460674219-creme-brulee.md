| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Heavy cream      | 2 cups          | Can substitute light cream or half-and-half |
| Vanilla bean     | 1 bean, split   | Or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract               |
| Salt             | ⅛ teaspoon      |                                             |
| Egg yolks        | 5               |                                             |

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C). In a saucepan, combine the cream, vanilla bean, and salt. Cook over low heat until just hot, then remove from heat and let sit for a few minutes. Discard the vanilla bean. If using vanilla extract, add it now.
2. In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar together until light and creamy. Gradually stir about a quarter of the warm cream into the egg mixture to temper the yolks. Then, pour the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining cream, stirring until combined.

3. Divide the custard mixture evenly between four 6-ounce ramekins. Place the ramekins in a baking dish, and pour boiling water into the dish until it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins.

4. Bake the custards for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the centers are just set but still slightly jiggly. Remove from the oven, let them cool completely, and then refrigerate for several hours (or up to 2 days) until fully chilled.

5. When ready to serve, sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of sugar evenly over the top of each custard. Place the ramekins under a broiler, 2 to 3 inches from the heat source, and broil for about 5 minutes, or until the sugar melts and browns (it may blacken slightly).

6. Serve the crème brûlée within 2 hours for the best texture.
