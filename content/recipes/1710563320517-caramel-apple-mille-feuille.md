## Puff Pastry

**Ingredients:**

- Puff pastry: 1 sheet (thawed)
- Powdered sugar: As needed (for dusting)

**Steps:**

1. Preheat the oven to 400째F (200째C).
2. Roll out the thawed puff pastry on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Prick the surface all over with a fork.
3. Cover with another sheet of parchment paper and place another baking sheet on top to weigh it down.
4. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Let it cool, then cut into 12 equal rectangles.
5. Dust with powdered sugar and briefly return to the oven to caramelize the sugar, about 2-3 minutes.

## Caramel Apple Layer

**Ingredients:**

- Apples: 4 medium (peeled, cored, and thinly sliced)
- Sugar: 1/2 cup
- Butter: 4 tbsp (3 tbsp for caramel, 1 tbsp for coating the pan)
- Cinnamon: 1 tsp (ground)

**Steps:**

1. Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C).
2. Coat the inside of a bread loaf pan with 1 tablespoon of butter to prevent sticking.
3. In a saucepan over medium heat, melt 3 tablespoons of butter and add the sugar. Stir until the sugar has completely melted and the mixture turns a golden-brown caramel color.
4. Pour the caramel into the prepared loaf pan, tilting it to coat the bottom evenly.
5. Layer the apple slices over the caramel in the loaf pan, sprinkling each layer with cinnamon.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until the apples are just tender. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.

## Cream Filling

**Ingredients:**

- Heavy cream: 1 cup (cold)
- Powdered sugar: 2 tbsp
- Vanilla extract: 1 tsp

**Steps:**

1. In a bowl, whisk the heavy cream until soft peaks form.
2. Add powdered sugar and vanilla extract, and continue to whisk until stiff peaks form.

## Assembly

**Steps:**

1. Place a piece of puff pastry on a plate.
2. Spread a layer of cream filling over the pastry.
3. Invert the bread loaf pan to release a layer of caramel-coated apples and place on top of the cream.
4. Place another piece of pastry on top and repeat the layers.
5. Top with the third piece of puff pastry, dust with powdered sugar, and serve immediately.
