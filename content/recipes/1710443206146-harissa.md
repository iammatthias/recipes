### Dried Peppers Harissa

#### Ingredients

| Ingredient      | Amount / Weight | Note                   |
| --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Dried chilies   | 4 ounces        | Seeded, stems removed  |
| Garlic cloves   | 3               | Peeled                 |
| Coriander seeds | 1 teaspoon      |                        |
| Cumin seeds     | 1 teaspoon      |                        |
| Caraway seeds   | 1/2 teaspoon    |                        |
| Salt            | 1 teaspoon      | Or to taste            |
| Olive oil       | 3 tablespoons   | Plus extra for storing |
| Lemon juice     | 1 tablespoon    | Freshly squeezed       |

#### Steps

1. Rehydrate dried chilies by soaking them in hot water for 30 minutes. Drain and remove any remaining seeds if desired.
2. In a dry skillet over medium heat, lightly toast the coriander, cumin, and caraway seeds until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Let them cool and then grind them into a fine powder.
3. In a food processor, combine the rehydrated chilies, ground spices, garlic cloves, salt, olive oil, and lemon juice. Blend until a smooth paste forms.
4. Transfer to a jar and cover the top with a thin layer of olive oil; this helps preserve the harissa. Store in the refrigerator for up to a month.
