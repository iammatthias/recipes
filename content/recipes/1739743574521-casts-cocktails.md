This menu was generated by a Frame called Casts & Cocktails. Frames are interactive apps that run directly in a Farcaster social feed and have native support on the Warpcast client.

Casts & Cocktails used AI to generate a personalized cocktail menu based on your posting history. I haven't tried all of these, but the ephemeral nature of the web means I might not get the chance to record these again.

**Yield:** 1 serving per cocktail
