## Steps

### Prep:

1. Season the chuck roast generously with salt and pepper.
2. Prepare the vegetables: dice the onion, carrots, and potatoes; trim the green beans; slice the mushrooms and zucchini.

### Grill:

1. Preheat your charcoal grill and set up the rotisserie. Place a cast iron pan underneath the roast to catch the drippings.
2. Place the garlic, shallot, bell peppers, and Fresno chili on the grate above the rotisserie so they roast while the chuck turns.
3. Cook the chuck roast on the rotisserie until it reaches an internal temperature of about 130-135°F for medium-rare, or longer for a more well-done roast.
4. Grill the garlic, shallot, and peppers until charred and soft. Remove them from the grill, peel, and set aside.
   - Mash the roasted garlic cloves.
   - Dice the roasted shallot.
   - Peel and dice the roasted bell peppers and Fresno chili.
5. Once the roast is done, let it rest for at least 10 minutes, then cut into bite-sized pieces.
6. Reserve the drippings from the cast iron pan.

### Cook Stock:

1. Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a large oven-safe pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté for 5-7 minutes until softened and translucent.
2. Add the diced carrots, roasted shallot, mashed roasted garlic, roasted bell peppers, and Fresno chili. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
3. Stir in the sweet paprika, smoked paprika, cumin, and caraway seeds (if using). Cook for another minute to toast the spices.
4. Pour in the vegetable broth, add bay leaves, and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Simmer the stock for 20-30 minutes to develop the flavors.

### Vegetarian Goulash:

1. In a separate pot, ladle half of the stock base.
2. Add the diced potatoes, zucchini, mushrooms, and green beans to the vegetarian stock.
3. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
4. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.

### Meat Goulash:

1. Keep the remaining half of the stock in the original pot. Add the rotisserie chuck roast pieces and the reserved drippings from the cast iron pan.
2. Pour in red wine (optional) and bring to a simmer.
3. Add the diced potatoes and cook for 30-40 minutes, or until the beef is tender and the potatoes are cooked through.
4. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.

### Slow-Cook in Oven:

1. Preheat the oven to 275°F (135°C).
2. Place the oven-safe pot with both goulashes (in separate pots or sections) in the oven.
3. Cover the pot(s) and slow-cook in the oven for 1.5 to 2 hours, allowing the flavors to meld and the meat to become more tender.
4. Remove from the oven and check seasoning, adjusting as needed.

### Serve:

1. Serve both goulash versions with crusty bread or over egg noodles, if desired.
2. Garnish both versions with fresh parsley and a dollop of sour cream for the meat version.
