| --------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Fresh pineapple cubes | 1/2 cup         | Muddled                      |
| Meyer lemon           | 1/2             | Juice and segments used      |

## Steps

### To prepare the Pineapple Rose Syrup:

1. In a small saucepan, muddle 1/2 cup fresh pineapple with the juice and segments from half a Meyer lemon.
2. Add 1/4 cup honey (or sugar) and 1 cup water, bringing the mixture to a gentle simmer over medium heat.
3. Once simmering, add 2-3 rose tea bags directly to the saucepan and let steep for about 5 minutes.
4. Remove the tea bags, continue simmering for another 5 minutes, then strain the syrup to remove the pineapple solids. Set aside to cool.

### To make the Rum Punch:

1. In a shaker, muddle the remaining fresh pineapple with the pulp of 2 passion fruits, the juice of the other half of the Meyer lemon, and the juice from half a lime.
2. Add a capful of grenadine, light rum, dark rum, spiced rum, apricot brandy, and a capful of Aperol (if using).
3. Add a dash of bitters and a dash of balsamic vinegar for added depth.
4. Instead of ice, add 1/2 cup of frozen cantaloupe to the shaker and shake vigorously to chill the drink.

### To assemble:

1. Mix the chilled punch with the prepared Pineapple Rose Syrup.
2. Strain the mixture into two chilled glasses half-filled with ice (or ideally, a large ice cube for slower dilution).
3. Garnish with a pineapple slice or citrus wedge if desired.
