**Yield:** 6-8 cakes

## Ingredients

| Ingredient    | Amount / Weight | Note           |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| crab          | 1 can (16 oz)   | well drained   |
| eggs          | 2               |                |
| mayonnaise    | 1 tablespoon    |                |
| Dijon mustard | 1 teaspoon      |                |
| dill          | 1 pinch         | fresh or dried |
| butter        | for sautéing    |                |

## Steps

1. In a large bowl, gently mix crab, eggs, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, and dill with a fork, taking care not to break up the crab too much. Form the mixture into patties.
2. Heat a skillet over medium heat and melt a sufficient amount of butter. Sauté the crab cakes until they are golden brown and fully firm, about 3-5 minutes per side.
3. Optional: For variations, you may add a sprinkle of Cajun spice to the crab mixture for a different flavor, but be mindful of the additional salt.
4. Note: While some recipes might suggest adding diced peppers, this version stays true to simplicity, focusing on the crab's flavor.

Serve the crab cakes with a side of tartar sauce or a squeeze of lemon for an enhanced taste.
