3. Once done, release pressure and let the spinach mixture cool slightly. Then purée in a food processor until smooth.
4. Set the Instant Pot to sauté mode and heat ghee or avocado oil. Add diced onion, minced garlic, and ginger paste. Cook until onions are translucent.
5. Add diced tomato, cook until soft. Then add salt and red chili powder to taste.

7. Add the puréed spinach mixture to the pot with paneer. Stir well.
8. Let the mixture simmer for 10-20 minutes. Cover with a splash guard or lid to prevent splattering.
