## Ingredients for Basic Naan

| Ingredient                 | Amount / Weight | Note           |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| All-purpose flour          | 4 cups          |                |
| Instant dry yeast          | 1 tbsp          |                |
| Kosher salt                | 2 tsp           |                |
| Baking soda                | ½ tsp           |                |
| Baking powder              | 1 tsp           |                |
| Plain yogurt or buttermilk | ¾ cup           |                |
| Warm water                 | 1 cup           | See note below |
| Butter                     | 4 tbsp          | Melted         |
| Minced cilantro            | 1 tbsp          | Optional       |

## Steps for Basic Naan

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, instant dry yeast, kosher salt, baking soda, and baking powder.
2. Add the plain yogurt (or buttermilk) and warm water to the dry ingredients. Mix until a soft dough forms.
3. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
4. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 to 1.5 hours or until doubled in size.
5. Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible with a pizza stone or heavy baking tray inside.
6. Divide the risen dough into 8 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball, then flatten into an oval shape about 1/8 inch thick.
7. Brush each piece of naan with melted butter and if desired, sprinkle with minced cilantro.
8. Place naan on the hot pizza stone or baking tray and bake for about 2 to 3 minutes or until puffy and lightly golden brown. Flip and bake for another 1-2 minutes.
9. Serve the naan warm.

## Ingredients for Sourdough Naan Variant

| Ingredient                | Amount / Weight | Note             |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Sourdough starter discard | 1 cup           |                  |
| Reduce instant dry yeast  | ½ tbsp          |                  |
| Reduce warm water         | ¾ cup           | Adjust as needed |

## Steps for Sourdough Naan Variant

1. Follow steps 1-2 of the Basic Naan recipe, but reduce the yeast to ½ tbsp and replace 1 cup of warm water with 1 cup of sourdough starter discard.
2. Adjust the amount of water as necessary to form a soft, manageable dough, noting that sourdough starter consistency can vary.
3. Proceed with steps 3-9 as outlined in the Basic Naan recipe, noting that the sourdough variant may require a slightly longer fermentation time, depending on the activity of your sourdough discard.

**Note for Basic and Sourdough Naan:** The water should be warm but not too hot to the touch (about 110°F or 45°C) to activate the yeast without killing it.
