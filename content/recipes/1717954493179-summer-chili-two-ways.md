## Steps

### Preparing the corn on the cob:

1. Carefully peel back the husks of the corn without removing them. Remove the silk strands and then fold the husks back into place.
2. Soak the ears of corn in cold water for about 15 minutes to prevent the husks from burning.
3. After soaking, remove the corn from the water and shake off any excess.
4. Spread a thin layer of butter over the kernels and then fold the husks back over the buttered corn.
5. Place the corn on the grill over medium heat, turning occasionally, for about 15-20 minutes or until the kernels are tender. Once done, remove the corn from the grill and let it cool slightly. Then, cut the kernels off the cob and set aside.

### Making the chilis:

1. Set up your charcoal or gas grill for direct grilling. Light the charcoal or preheat the gas grill to medium-high heat.
2. Place the boneless short ribs directly on the grill grates over the hot coals or burners. Sear the short ribs on all sides until they develop a good crust, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove the short ribs from the grill and set aside.
3. Place the zucchini and yellow squash directly on the grill grates over the hot coals or burners. Sear on all sides until they develop a good crust, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove from the grill, allow to cool slightly, then dice and scoop out the seeds.
4. Place a large cast-iron pot or Dutch oven on the grill over medium heat. Allow it to heat up for a few minutes.
5. In a separate grill-safe pan, add 2 tbsp of olive oil and heat over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the chopped onions and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
6. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.
7. Stir in the chopped bell peppers and cook until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes.
8. Stir in the canned black beans and cook until heated through.
9. Season the vegetable mixture with salt, black pepper, 1 tbsp of chili powder, 1 tbsp of ground cumin, and 2 tsp of paprika.
10. If making both chilis, divide the vegetable mixture, setting half aside for the vegetarian chili. If making one batch, keep it all together.

### To make the meat chili:

11. In the cast-iron pot, add 2 tbsp of olive oil and the ground chuck. Cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks.
12. Season the ground chuck with salt, black pepper, 1 tbsp of chili powder, 1/2 tbsp of ground cumin, and 1 tsp of paprika.
13. Return the seared short ribs to the pot with the ground chuck.
14. Add half (or all, if making one batch) of the seasoned vegetable mixture to the pot.
15. Stir in the canned diced tomatoes with their juice.
16. Add the remaining 1 tbsp of chili powder, 1/2 tbsp of ground cumin, and 1 tsp of paprika. Stir well to combine.
17. Move the pot to a cooler part of the grill to cook over indirect heat. Cover the grill and let the chili simmer for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender and the flavors are well combined.
18. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.
19. Serve the meat chili hot, garnished with fresh cilantro, grilled buttered corn kernels, sour cream (optional), and lime wedges on the side.

### To make the vegetarian chili:

20. In a separate large cast-iron pot or Dutch oven on the grill over medium heat, add 2 tbsp of olive oil. Allow it to heat up for a few minutes.
21. Add the diced zucchini and yellow squash, cooking until they start to soften, about 5 minutes.
22. Add the remaining half of the seasoned vegetable mixture (or all, if making one batch) to the pot.
23. Stir in the canned diced tomatoes with their juice, black beans, and kidney beans.
24. Season with the remaining 1 tbsp of chili powder, 1/2 tbsp of ground cumin, and 1 tsp of paprika. Adjust with salt and black pepper to taste.
25. Move the pot to a cooler part of the grill to cook over indirect heat. Cover the grill and let the chili simmer for about 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and the flavors are well combined.
26. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.
27. Serve the vegetarian chili hot, garnished with fresh cilantro, grilled buttered corn kernels, sour cream (optional), and lime wedges on the side.
