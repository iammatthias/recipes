## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C), utilizing convection mode if possible.
2. Place a small amount of butter (1/4 to 1/2 tsp per muffin well or 2 tsp for a baking dish) into your baking vessel. Put it in the oven to melt the butter as it heats.
3. In a stand mixer, combine flour, milk, water, eggs, and salt. Mix on HIGH, pausing once to scrape down the sides, then continue until fully mixed.
4. Once the butter in the oven starts to brown, remove the pan and swirl to coat the surface.
5. Pour the batter immediately into the hot pan or muffin tin.
6. Place the dish or tin back into the oven without delay.
7. Bake for approximately 20 minutes, starting to check for doneness at 18 minutes.
8. After baking, let cool slightly then serve. They are also good the following day.

Note: Yorkshire pudding is best served with roast beef and gravy, but they are versatile enough to accompany many dishes or be enjoyed on their own.

Enjoy your delicious, fluffy Yorkshire pudding as a classic addition to any meal.
