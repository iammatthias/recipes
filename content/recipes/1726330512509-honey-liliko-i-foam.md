## Steps

1. Combine the honey, passionfruit purée, simple syrup, egg white, and cold water in a blender. Blend until the mixture is smooth and fully emulsified.
2. Strain the blended mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any solids or pulp for a smoother consistency.
3. Pour the strained liquid into a whipped cream siphon.
4. Charge the siphon with 1 N2O cartridge, then shake it well to incorporate air into the mixture and create the foam.
5. Chill the siphon for at least 30 minutes before dispensing to allow the foam to set and hold its structure when served.
