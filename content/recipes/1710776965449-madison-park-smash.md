## Steps

1. In a shaker, combine the Cognac, Royal Combier, lemon juice, Demerara syrup, and mint leaves.
2. Shake the mixture with a few cubes of ice using a whip shake technique to blend the ingredients without overly diluting the mixture.
3. Pour the mix into a large vessel.
4. Fill the vessel almost to the top with crushed ice.
5. Dash liberally with Angostura bitters over the crushed ice.
6. Top with additional crushed ice to form a small mound.
7. Garnish with a mint bouquet to add aroma and enhance presentation.
