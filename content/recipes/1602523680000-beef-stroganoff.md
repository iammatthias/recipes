## Steps

1. In a large skillet, saut√© garlic, onions, and mushrooms in butter over medium heat. Add the cubed tri-tip and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
2. Once the meat is browned on one side, pour in the red wine. A robust wine like cabernet, merlot, or syrah is recommended.
3. Reduce heat to low and simmer until the meat is tender and falling apart. Then turn off the heat.
4. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the egg noodles and cook according to package instructions.
5. Return to the meat mixture, now slightly cooled, and stir in the half and half.
6. Stir in the sour cream. Adjust salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste, now that the cream has been added.
7. Replace the lid on the skillet and turn the heat back to low. Ensure the sauce is warm but not boiling.
8. Drain the noodles thoroughly.
9. Serve the beef stroganoff over the cooked egg noodles. Enjoy!
