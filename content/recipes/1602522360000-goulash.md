## Steps

1. Heat your Instant Pot on sauté mode or your Dutch Oven on high heat. Add some paprika and ground pepper to toast lightly.
2. Add stew beef and stir to coat with spices. Allow beef to brown, stirring occasionally. Remove beef to a bowl once done.
3. Cube onions. In the same pot, add olive oil, additional paprika, and pepper. Add onions and cook until translucent.
4. Return the beef to the pot. Add more paprika, pepper, and salt. Stir and let sear.
5. Add 2/3 of the beer and the potatoes. Stir well and bring to a simmer.
6. For Instant Pot: Close lid and set to Stew mode for 35 minutes. For Dutch Oven: Transfer to a 250°F oven and cook for two hours or until beef is tender.
7. Mix remaining beer with rice flour to form a batter. Once cooking is complete, return pot to high heat and stir in the batter to thicken the goulash.
8. Adjust seasoning with salt, paprika, and pepper.
9. Serve with a dollop of sour cream and a side of robust green vegetables like green beans or broccoli.

Note: This goulash recipe emphasizes simplicity and traditional flavors, avoiding tomatoes and excessive vegetables for a focused taste.
