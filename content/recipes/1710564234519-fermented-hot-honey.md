**Yield:** Approximately 2 cups

## Ingredients

| Ingredient          | Amount / Weight | Note                       |
| ------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Raw honey           | 1 cup           | Unfiltered                 |
| Fresh garlic        | 3 cloves        | Peeled and lightly crushed |
| Fresh shallots      | 2               | Peeled and thinly sliced   |
| Fresh chili peppers | 4-6             | Sliced, adjust to taste    |
| Sea salt            | 1-2 teaspoons   | Adjust based on preference |

## Steps

1. In a clean, dry bowl, mix the sliced chili peppers, garlic, and shallots with the sea salt. Ensure that the vegetables are well coated with the salt. The salt helps to inhibit the growth of unwanted bacteria while promoting the growth of good bacteria for fermentation.
2. Transfer the salted vegetables into a clean, dry jar.
3. Pour the raw honey over the salted vegetables, ensuring they are completely submerged. If the honey is too thick, slightly warm it to make it more pourable but ensure it is not hot as high temperatures can kill beneficial bacteria.
4. Cover the jar with a breathable material like cheesecloth or a coffee filter and secure it with a rubber band. This setup allows gases to escape while keeping contaminants out.
5. Place the jar in a dark, room-temperature spot for 1 to 4 weeks. Check daily, stirring the mixture with a clean spoon to release gases and prevent mold formation.
6. Taste the honey after 1 week, and every week thereafter, until it reaches your desired level of fermentation.
7. Once fermentation is complete, replace the breathable cover with a tight-fitting lid and store the fermented hot honey in the refrigerator. It can be stored for several months.

**Notes:**

- The amount of salt can be adjusted based on personal preference and the volume of vegetables used. More salt can result in a slower fermentation process.
- Dry fermenting creates less liquid than brine fermenting. If your honey is not covering the ingredients after a few days, you can mix in a little non-chlorinated water to ensure they are submerged.
- Regularly check the mixture during fermentation to ensure that it does not dry out and that mold does not form.
- The fermented honey can be used as a drizzle on pizza, cheese, fried chicken, or incorporated into dressings and marinades.
- Adjust the amount and type of chili peppers based on your preferred level of spiciness.
- Ensure all utensils and the jar are clean to avoid unwanted bacteria entering the fermentation process.
