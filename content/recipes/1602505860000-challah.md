| salt           | 2 tsp           |                   |

## Steps

1. In a bowl of a stand mixer, or just a bowl: 1 cup water, 1 packet of yeast (or about 2.5 tsp) and a bit of sugar.
2. Let sit until foamy.
3. In a separate bowl, mix flour and salt.
4. Once yeast and water is foamy, mix in flour + salt, honey (or sugar), oil, and eggs.
5. Mix / knead for 8-10 minutes.
6. Let proof for 1 hour.
7. After proofing, punch down and divide into 4 equal pieces. Roll the pieces into ropes.
8. Braid - traditionally challah is round in the fall around Rosh Hashanah, but braiding a normal loaf is fine.
9. Let braided loaf rise for 30-45 minutes.
10. Coat loaf in an egg wash — egg, water, and honey.
11. Bake for 30-35 minutes at 350°F.
12. Enjoy.
