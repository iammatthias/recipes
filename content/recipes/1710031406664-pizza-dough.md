## Ingredients

| Ingredient             | Amount / Weight                          | Note     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 00 flour               | 306 grams (2 cups plus 2 tbsp)           |          |
| all-purpose flour      | 306 grams (2 cups plus 2 tbsp and 4 tsp) |          |
| fine sea salt          | 16 grams (2 tsp)                         |          |
| active dry yeast       | 4 grams (1.5 tsp)                        |          |
| extra-virgin olive oil | 8 grams (2 tsp)                          | optional |

## Steps

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the 00 flour, all-purpose flour, and fine sea salt.
2. In a separate container, dissolve the active dry yeast in 400 grams of cold water.
3. Pour the yeast mixture into the flour mixture and mix by hand until a rough dough forms.
4. Add the olive oil (if using) and continue to mix until fully incorporated.
5. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 10-15 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
6. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions.
7. Shape each portion into a ball and place them on a floured surface or tray.
8. Place the dough balls in an oven with the light on and let rise for 2 hours.
9. Transfer the dough balls to the refrigerator and let them rest for 1-2 hours.
10. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature before using (about 1 hour).
11. Preheat your pizza oven outside to its highest setting.
12. On a floured surface, stretch each dough ball into a 12-inch round, being careful not to deflate the edges.
13. Top with your favorite ingredients and bake one pizza at a time for 6-8 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the toppings are cooked.
