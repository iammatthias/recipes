### Steps

1. **Prepare the aromatics:** Finely chop the shallot, garlic, ginger, and chilli. Bash the lemongrass to release its flavor.
2. **Sauté the aromatics:** Heat the neutral oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the aromatics and sauté for 3-5 minutes, stirring well to combine flavors.
3. **Flavor the broth:** Stir in the soy sauce, rice vinegar, and optional curry paste. Cook for another 2-3 minutes to deepen the flavors.
4. **Add broth and simmer:** Slowly pour in the vegetable broth, stirring as you go. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for 15-20 minutes.
5. **Add coconut cream:** Strain the broth through a sieve to remove the aromatics, then return the broth to the pot. Add the coconut cream. If the soup is too thick, dilute with an additional 100-150 ml of vegetable broth or water, as needed. Simmer gently.
6. **Cook mushrooms and tofu:** Add the sliced mushrooms and tofu to the broth and cook until softened, about 5-10 minutes.
7. **Finish with herbs and seasoning:** Stir in the chopped spring onions and coriander. Season with sugar, lime zest, lime juice, salt, and pepper to taste.
8. **Serve:** Serve the soup in deep bowls, garnishing with extra red chilli, coriander, lime wedges, and a swirl of Thai chilli oil, if desired. Enjoy!

## Char-Grilled Pork Loin

### Ingredients

| Ingredient    | Amount    | Note                           |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| pork loin     | 300g-400g | trimmed                        |
| garlic cloves | 2         | minced                         |
| soy sauce     | 2 tbsp    |                                |
| lime juice    | 1 tbsp    | fresh                          |
| brown sugar   | 1 tsp     | optional, for slight sweetness |
| fish sauce    | 1 tsp     | optional, for umami            |
| neutral oil   | 1 tbsp    | to brush the pork              |
| salt          | to taste  |                                |
| black pepper  | to taste  | freshly ground                 |

### Steps

1. **Marinate the pork:** In a small bowl, mix together the minced garlic, soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar (if using), and fish sauce (if using). Rub the mixture all over the pork loin, making sure it's evenly coated. Let the pork marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator.
2. **Prepare the grill:** Set up your charcoal grill for two-zone cooking: pile the lit coals on one side of the grill to create a hot direct-heat zone, and leave the other side for indirect heat. This allows you to sear the pork first and then finish cooking it slowly without burning.

3. **Grill the pork:**

   - **Searing:** Brush the pork loin with a little neutral oil to prevent sticking. Place the pork over the hot direct-heat zone and sear for 2-3 minutes per side, until nicely charred and browned.
   - **Finishing:** Move the pork to the indirect heat zone and continue grilling, turning occasionally, until the internal temperature reaches 145°F (63°C). This should take about 10-15 minutes depending on the thickness of the pork.

4. **Rest and slice:** Once the pork reaches the correct internal temperature, remove it from the grill. Let it rest for 5-10 minutes, covered loosely with foil, to allow the juices to redistribute. Slice the pork thinly for serving.

5. **Serve alongside the tom kha:** Serve the char-grilled pork loin with your tom kha, and optionally garnish with fresh lime wedges or coriander.
